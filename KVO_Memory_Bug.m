In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  Specifically, if an observer is not removed when it's no longer needed (e.g., the observed object is deallocated or the observer itself is deallocated), it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This often happens when an observer is added within a method that doesn't explicitly remove it in its counterpart (like dealloc or a view controller's viewDidDisappear).
