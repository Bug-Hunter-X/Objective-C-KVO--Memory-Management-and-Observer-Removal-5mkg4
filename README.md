# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common memory management issue in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO).  Failure to remove KVO observers can result in crashes or undefined behavior when the observed object or the observer is deallocated.

The `KVO_Memory_Bug.m` file showcases the bug, while `KVO_Memory_Solution.m` provides a corrected version with proper observer removal.

## Bug Description
The bug arises from adding a KVO observer without properly removing it when it's no longer necessary. This leads to dangling pointers and potential crashes when the observed object is deallocated.

## Solution
The solution involves diligently removing the observer in the appropriate method, such as `dealloc` or `viewDidDisappear`, ensuring that the observer is removed before the observed object is deallocated.
